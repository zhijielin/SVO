# SVO
Robot Pose Estimation with SVO using RGB-D Camera

This is about a project to estimate the pose of a pendulum robot with RGB-D camera. 
This algorithm is based on feature points. 

Process: keypoints detection-> description -> matching(2D-2D) -> point cloud -image (3D-2d) -> solve PnP -> update

To be continued: key frame, ORB-SLAM
